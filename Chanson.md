**Peaches & Cream** - The John Butler Trio

````
Well there's far too many questions to ask
To answer all of them tonight
For I wear, too many masks
To tell if any of them are wrong or right
And confusion casts a shadow upon me
Like a great big cloud in the sky
And now I pray for rain
'Cause it's been so long since I let myself cry
For so long, I've sang this sad ole song
And it feels like my time is up
For she came and landed in my arms
And she filled my half empty cup
Yes she filled my half empty cup
There you are
Right in front of me
A brand new day
Sunrise over sea
No longer
My cup half empty
'Cause there you are
You and your mum in front of me
In front of me
And now I look up above me
And I thank that great old God in the sky
For telling me my cup ain't half empty
I took my little girl to show me why
For so long, I've sang this sad ole song
And it feels like my time is up
For she came and landed in my arms
And she filled my half empty cup
Yes she filled my half empty cup
There you are
Right in front of me
A brand new day
Sunrise over sea
No longer
My cup half empty
'Cause there you are
You and your mum in front of me
Your peaches and cream to me
You both are peaches and cream to me
Peaches and cream to me
You and your mum in front of me
Your peaches and a cream oh
Yeah I, love you
All I know is
All I know that I
I Love you
That I love you
All I know is
All I know
And I love you
Yeah I, love you, yeah
